# You Don't Know JS: Scope & Closures
# Chapter 4: Hoisting

## Chicken Or The Egg?

Program is not read top to bottom.

Consider this code:

```js
a = 2;

var a;

console.log( a );
```

This prints `2`.

```js
console.log( a );

var a = 2;
```

This prints `undefined`, the assignment is left in place while the declaration is hoisted.

Hoisting is *per-scope*:

```js
foo();

function foo() {
	console.log( a ); // undefined

	var a = 2;
}
```

```js
function foo() {
	var a;

	console.log( a ); // undefined

	a = 2;
}

foo();
```

Function declarations are hoisted, as we just saw. But function expressions are not.

```js
foo(); // not ReferenceError, but TypeError!

var foo = function bar() {
	// ...
};
```

Also recall that even though it's a named function expression, the name identifier is not available in the enclosing scope:

```js
foo(); // TypeError
bar(); // ReferenceError

var foo = function bar() {
	// ...
};
```

This snippet is more accurately interpreted (with hoisting) as:

```js
var foo;

foo(); // TypeError
bar(); // ReferenceError

foo = function() {
	var bar = ...self...
	// ...
}
```

## Functions First

Both function declarations and variable declarations are hoisted. But a subtle detail (that *can* show up in code with multiple "duplicate" declarations) is that functions are hoisted first, and then variables.

Consider:

```js
foo(); // 1

var foo;

function foo() {
	console.log( 1 );
}

foo = function() {
	console.log( 2 );
};
```

`1` is printed instead of `2`! This snippet is interpreted by the *Engine* as:

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( 1 );
}

foo(); // 1

foo = function() {
	console.log( 2 );
};
```

Notice that `var foo` was the duplicate (and thus ignored) declaration, even though it came before the `function foo()...` declaration, because function declarations are hoisted before normal variables.

While multiple/duplicate `var` declarations are effectively ignored, subsequent function declarations *do* override previous ones.

```js
foo(); // 3

function foo() {
	console.log( 1 );
}

var foo = function() {
	console.log( 2 );
};

function foo() {
	console.log( 3 );
}
```

While this all may sound like nothing more than interesting academic trivia, it highlights the fact that duplicate definitions in the same scope are a really bad idea and will often lead to confusing results.

Function declarations that appear inside of normal blocks typically hoist to the enclosing scope, rather than being conditional as this code implies:

```js
foo(); // "b"

var a = true;
if (a) {
   function foo() { console.log( "a" ); }
}
else {
   function foo() { console.log( "b" ); }
}
```

However, it's important to note that this behavior is not reliable and is subject to change in future versions of JavaScript, so it's probably best to avoid declaring functions in blocks.

## Review (TL;DR)

We can be tempted to look at `var a = 2;` as one statement, but the JavaScript *Engine* does not see it that way. It sees `var a` and `a = 2` as two separate statements, the first one a compiler-phase task, and the second one an execution-phase task.

What this leads to is that all declarations in a scope, regardless of where they appear, are processed *first* before the code itself is executed. You can visualize this as declarations (variables and functions) being "moved" to the top of their respective scopes, which we call "hoisting".

Declarations themselves are hoisted, but assignments, even assignments of function expressions, are *not* hoisted.

Be careful about duplicate declarations, especially mixed between normal var declarations and function declarations -- peril awaits if you do!
