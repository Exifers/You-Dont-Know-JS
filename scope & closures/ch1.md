# You Don't Know JS: Scope & Closures
# Chapter 1: What is Scope?

## Compiler Theory

Javascript is a compiled language.

In a traditional compiled-language process, a chunk of source code, your program, will undergo typically three steps *before* it is executed, roughly called "compilation":

1. **Tokenizing/Lexing:** breaking up a string of characters into meaningful (to the language) chunks, called tokens. For instance, consider the program: `var a = 2;`. This program would likely be broken up into the following tokens: `var`, `a`, `=`, `2`, and `;`. Whitespace may or may not be persisted as a token, depending on whether it's meaningful or not.

    **Note:** The difference between tokenizing and lexing is subtle and academic, but it centers on whether or not these tokens are identified in a *stateless* or *stateful* way. Put simply, if the tokenizer were to invoke stateful parsing rules to figure out whether `a` should be considered a distinct token or just part of another token, *that* would be **lexing**.

2. **Parsing:** taking a stream (array) of tokens and turning it into a tree of nested elements, which collectively represent the grammatical structure of the program. This tree is called an "AST" (<b>A</b>bstract <b>S</b>yntax <b>T</b>ree).

    The tree for `var a = 2;` might start with a top-level node called `VariableDeclaration`, with a child node called `Identifier` (whose value is `a`), and another child called `AssignmentExpression` which itself has a child called `NumericLiteral` (whose value is `2`).

3. **Code-Generation:** the process of taking an AST and turning it into executable code. This part varies greatly depending on the language, the platform it's targeting, etc.

    So, rather than get mired in details, we'll just handwave and say that there's a way to take our above described AST for `var a = 2;` and turn it into a set of machine instructions to actually *create* a variable called `a` (including reserving memory, etc.), and then store a value into `a`.

    **Note:** The details of how the engine manages system resources are deeper than we will dig, so we'll just take it for granted that the engine is able to create and store variables as needed.

The Javascript engine is actually more complex than that.

Let's just say, for simplicity's sake, that any snippet of JavaScript has to be compiled before (usually *right* before!) it's executed. So, the JS compiler will take the program `var a = 2;` and compile it *first*, and then be ready to execute it, usually right away.

## Understanding Scope

The way we will approach learning about scope is to think of the process in terms of a conversation. But, *who* is having the conversation?

### The Cast

Let's meet the cast of characters that interact to process the program `var a = 2;`, so we understand their conversations that we'll listen in on shortly:

1. *Engine*: responsible for start-to-finish compilation and execution of our JavaScript program.

2. *Compiler*: one of *Engine*'s friends; handles all the dirty work of parsing and code-generation (see previous section).

3. *Scope*: another friend of *Engine*; collects and maintains a look-up list of all the declared identifiers (variables), and enforces a strict set of rules as to how these are accessible to currently executing code.

For you to *fully understand* how JavaScript works, you need to begin to *think* like *Engine* (and friends) think, ask the questions they ask, and answer those questions the same.

### Back & Forth

When you see the program `var a = 2;`, you most likely think of that as one statement. But that's not how our new friend *Engine* sees it. In fact, *Engine* sees two distinct statements, one which *Compiler* will handle during compilation, and one which *Engine* will handle during execution.

So, let's break down how *Engine* and friends will approach the program `var a = 2;`.

The first thing *Compiler* will do with this program is perform lexing to break it down into tokens, which it will then parse into a tree. But when *Compiler* gets to code-generation, it will treat this program somewhat differently than perhaps assumed.

A reasonable assumption would be that *Compiler* will produce code that could be summed up by this pseudo-code: "Allocate memory for a variable, label it `a`, then stick the value `2` into that variable." Unfortunately, that's not quite accurate.

*Compiler* will instead proceed as:

1. Encountering `var a`, *Compiler* asks *Scope* to see if a variable `a` already exists for that particular scope collection. If so, *Compiler* ignores this declaration and moves on. Otherwise, *Compiler* asks *Scope* to declare a new variable called `a` for that scope collection.

2. *Compiler* then produces code for *Engine* to later execute, to handle the `a = 2` assignment. The code *Engine* runs will first ask *Scope* if there is a variable called `a` accessible in the current scope collection. If so, *Engine* uses that variable. If not, *Engine* looks *elsewhere* (see nested *Scope* section below).

If *Engine* eventually finds a variable, it assigns the value `2` to it. If not, *Engine* will raise its hand and yell out an error!

To summarize: two distinct actions are taken for a variable assignment: First, *Compiler* declares a variable (if not previously declared in the current scope), and second, when executing, *Engine* looks up the variable in *Scope* and assigns to it, if found.

## Errors

Why does it matter whether we call it LHS or RHS?

Because these two types of look-ups behave differently in the circumstance where the variable has not yet been declared (is not found in any consulted *Scope*).

Consider:

```js
function foo(a) {
	console.log( a + b );
	b = a;
}

foo( 2 );
```

When the RHS look-up occurs for `b` the first time, it will not be found. This is said to be an "undeclared" variable, because it is not found in the scope.

If an RHS look-up fails to ever find a variable, anywhere in the nested *Scope*s, this results in a `ReferenceError` being thrown by the *Engine*. It's important to note that the error is of the type `ReferenceError`.

By contrast, if the *Engine* is performing an LHS look-up and arrives at the top floor (global *Scope*) without finding it, and if the program is not running in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode], then the global *Scope* will create a new variable of that name **in the global scope**, and hand it back to *Engine*.

*"No, there wasn't one before, but I was helpful and created one for you."*

"Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode], which was added in ES5, has a number of different behaviors from normal/relaxed/lazy mode. One such behavior is that it disallows the automatic/implicit global variable creation. In that case, there would be no global *Scope*'d variable to hand back from an LHS look-up, and *Engine* would throw a `ReferenceError` similarly to the RHS case.

Now, if a variable is found for an RHS look-up, but you try to do something with its value that is impossible, such as trying to execute-as-function a non-function value, or reference a property on a `null` or `undefined` value, then *Engine* throws a different kind of error, called a `TypeError`.

`ReferenceError` is *Scope* resolution-failure related, whereas `TypeError` implies that *Scope* resolution was successful, but that there was an illegal/impossible action attempted against the result.

## Review (TL;DR)

Scope is the set of rules that determines where and how a variable (identifier) can be looked-up. This look-up may be for the purposes of assigning to the variable, which is an LHS (left-hand-side) reference, or it may be for the purposes of retrieving its value, which is an RHS (right-hand-side) reference.

LHS references result from assignment operations. *Scope*-related assignments can occur either with the `=` operator or by passing arguments to (assign to) function parameters.

The JavaScript *Engine* first compiles code before it executes, and in so doing, it splits up statements like `var a = 2;` into two separate steps:

1. First, `var a` to declare it in that *Scope*. This is performed at the beginning, before code execution.

2. Later, `a = 2` to look up the variable (LHS reference) and assign to it if found.

Both LHS and RHS reference look-ups start at the currently executing *Scope*, and if need be (that is, they don't find what they're looking for there), they work their way up the nested *Scope*, one scope (floor) at a time, looking for the identifier, until they get to the global (top floor) and stop, and either find it, or don't.

Unfulfilled RHS references result in `ReferenceError`s being thrown. Unfulfilled LHS references result in an automatic, implicitly-created global of that name (if not in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode]), or a `ReferenceError` (if in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode]).

### Quiz Answers

```js
function foo(a) {
	var b = a;
	return a + b;
}

var c = foo( 2 );
```

1. Identify all the LHS look-ups (there are 3!).

	**`c = ..`, `a = 2` (implicit param assignment) and `b = ..`**

2. Identify all the RHS look-ups (there are 4!).

    **`foo(2..`, `= a;`, `a + ..` and `.. + b`**
